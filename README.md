# Butter Passwords
ButterPasswords is a way to securely save passwords from any website! Just simply install the extension, then the next time you sign up for something, a window will popup allowing you to enter a password that the extension will enter for you next time you log in to that site!
  
# Are we actually secure?
No, not really lol. This extension is really basic.
